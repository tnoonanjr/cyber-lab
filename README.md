# Overview

## Lab 1 - Passwords & Hashing
Given a list of target users crack their passwords. Each question has varying levels of security. Using different methods bypass basic password defense mechanisms with the information available.

## Lab 2 - Malware
Create a virus that can direct command line inputs of a file to a log file. Give the infected file the ability to spread the infection. Create a worm that finds vulnerable machines, tries to log in, and spread the malicious code. Create macro scripts for the Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky that can type the malware contents onto a computer.

## Lab 3 - Ransomware & Cryptography
Experiment verifying validity of files using checksums. Given a directory of executables and a signature find the executable matching the signature. Given the encryption algorithm decrypt messages. The algorithm can be clear or obfuscated or written in a manner to cause confusion. Create a mock ransomware framework encrypting files and a shared key using a asymmetric encryption i.e. mathmatically linked public & private key pair where the private key is necessary to return files back to their original state.

## Lab 4 - Web Programming & Phishing Attacks
