# Lab 3 - Cryptography, Malware & Ransomware


## Questions 1-3 - Checksum

### Question 1
Given a folder of executable files, check for a match for the target hash via brute force running each file.


### Question 2
Given a folder of executable files, check for a match for the target hash by hashing each executable (...?) and checking for equality.


### Question 3
Given a public key, check for authenticity via checking .sign files against the public key.

## Questions 4-5 - Decrypt

### Question 4
Given a python file that encrypts file, develop an algorithm to decrypt the files.

### Question 5
Given a obfucated file; i.e. a file that is written in a way to hide its true purposes, develop an algorithm to decrypt the file.


## Question 6 - Ransomware
