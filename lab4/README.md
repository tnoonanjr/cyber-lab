# Lab 4 - Web Programming & Phishing Attacks

#### This lab uses webpages hosted locally, and is not possible to fully replicate using this repository. This overview & the code provide should outline the tasks assigned and the process to complete them.

## Question 1 - Access the web page
Using ssh tunneling access the mock bank web page with your given username and password (no code necessary).

## Question 2 - Crack a user's account
Given a file of common passwords send requests to the http server to log in until you find a successful log in.

## Question 3 - Intro to Flask
Make a minimal web app using Flask as the backend.

## Question 4 - Intro to Phishing
Create a false version of the mock bank that will log victims' attempts to log into their account. To reduce suspicion, redirect victim's login attempt to the real server such that it seems they were always on the original page.

## Question 5 - Phishing Continued
Sometimes websites are more obfuscated. Read and understand the custom page's script and adapt the phishing page to link to the new image locations.

## Question 6 - Keylogger
Adapt the phishing page to log keystrokes such that if a victim does not even submit the form their login data is still logged.
